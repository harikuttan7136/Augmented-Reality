Creating Augmented reality pictures / videos

The problem statement is as follows 

1. Calibrate the camera on your smartphone (intrinsic parameters) using the system using a checkerboard
pattern as described in class.
2. Placing the checkerboard on a table, insert some artificial objects on the table (such as a simple pyramid
etc.) and generate some mixed/augmented-reality pictures. This need not be real-time but can be done
on pictures taken from the smartphone.
